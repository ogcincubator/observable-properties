## Exercise 4

Goal: Define a Building Block for a semantic data model

This approach is appropriate where a given schema is one of many possible schemas for the same underlying semantic model, and allows defining the model and logical constraints independently, with re-usable validation rules and unit testing advantages.

### Steps
- uncomment line
- examine file "ontology.ttl"
- run build
- run viewer
- navigate to "Exercise 9"/Ontology and examine classes
- view validation results on "about tab"
- view validation results at [Validation Report](validation) or [build-local/...](/register/build-local/tests/bbr/template/exercise3/_report.json)
